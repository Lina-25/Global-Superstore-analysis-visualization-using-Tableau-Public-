# 🛒 Superstore Data Analysis Dashboard

In this project, I worked with **Superstore Data** in Tableau to create interactive visualizations that break down key metrics such as **Order Priority**, **Shipping Costs**, **Sales by Region**, **Profit Margin by Category**, and more. The dashboard allows for dynamic exploration of data, providing key insights through various types of charts, including pie charts, line charts, and scatter plots.

## 🖥️ Dashboard Visualizations  
1️⃣ **Order Priority Breakdown (Pie Chart)** – A **pie chart** showing the percentage breakdown of **Order Priority** (Critical, High, Medium, Low). When hovering over the segments, **tooltips** display detailed information, including the count of orders per priority and the percentage of the total order count.  
2️⃣ **Shipping Cost Analysis** – This section provides an analysis of **Shipping Costs** by displaying the **count of Order IDs** (29,433 orders) and the **percentage of total order count**. The **tooltips** display additional details about the **Order Priority**, giving users insights into the shipping cost distribution by priority.  
3️⃣ **Sales by Region (Bar Chart)** – A **bar chart** showing **Sales by Region**, arranged in order of highest to lowest sales for better visual comparison.  
4️⃣ **Average Shipping Cost Analysis (Line Chart)** – A **line chart** showing the **average shipping costs** over each year. The chart illustrates a **declining trend** in shipping costs over time. No markers are used to avoid clutter.  
5️⃣ **Profit Margin by Category (Scatter Plot)** – A **scatter plot** showing **Profit Margin by Category**, with each point representing a different category. The **marks** on the scatter plot are not connected by a line, as it represents individual data points, not a trend.  
6️⃣ **Interactive Filters** – Filters placed on the side of the dashboard allow users to explore the data by selecting **Category**, **Year of Ship**, **Shipping Mode**, **Region**, **Order Priority**, and **Count of Order ID**. This makes the dashboard interactive and enables users to customize their view of the data.

## ✨ Key Skills & Techniques Demonstrated  
✅ **Data Preparation & Cleaning** – Processed and prepared the **Superstore Data** for visualization in Tableau, ensuring the data was ready for analysis.  
✅ **Pie Chart Visualization** – Created a **pie chart** to represent the **Order Priority** breakdown and added **tooltips** to provide detailed information on the segments.  
✅ **Shipping Cost Analysis** – Visualized shipping cost data, including total counts and percentages, to understand cost distribution.  
✅ **Bar Charts & Line Charts** – Used **bar charts** to visualize sales by region and **line charts** for showing trends in shipping costs.  
✅ **Scatter Plot** – Created a **scatter plot** to analyze the relationship between **Profit Margin** and **Category**.  
✅ **Interactive Filters** – Added **interactive filters** to allow dynamic exploration of the data by **category**, **year**, **region**, and **order priority**.  
✅ **Calculated Fields** – Used calculated fields to derive metrics like the **Profit Margin**, **average shipping costs**, and percentage of orders by priority.  
✅ **Trend Analysis** – Analyzed **shipping cost trends** over time, discovering a **decline** in shipping costs.  
✅ **Tooltips** – Added **hover-over tooltips** to each chart to provide additional details about the data, helping users better understand the context of the visualizations.  
✅ **Data Storytelling** – Designed the dashboard with **user-friendly** visualizations, ensuring key findings were easily accessible and understandable.

## 🚀 How to Use the Dashboard  
1. **View the dashboard on [Tableau Public](#)https://public.tableau.com/shared/CHH3646B3?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link.**  
2. **Hover over the pie chart** to see the breakdown of **Order Priority** and the percentage of total order count for each segment.  
3. **Use the filters** on the side to adjust the data by **Category**, **Year**, **Shipping Mode**, **Region**, and **Order Priority**.  
4. **Explore the Sales by Region chart** to view sales figures, sorted from highest to lowest.  
5. **Check the trend in shipping costs** by viewing the **Average Shipping Cost Analysis** line chart.  
6. **Examine the scatter plot** to understand the **Profit Margin by Category**.

## 📊 Key Findings  
🔹 The **Technology** category made the **biggest profit margin** across all categories.  
🔹 **Western Europe** had the highest total sales in all regions, with **$1,731,930** in sales.  
🔹 **Medium Priority Orders** accounted for **57.39%** of the total order count.  
🔹 **Shipping costs** have been **declining** each year, with noticeable reductions in recent years.  
🔹 **Western Europe** had the highest number of orders and the most significant sales, contributing to the highest profit margin.  
🔹 The **scatter plot** showed a clear distribution of **profit margin by category**, helping identify categories with the highest profitability.
